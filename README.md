1: Compiling_data.py:
        this lines of code used to make changes in data so it could be usefull for using and applying Ml algo. on that.
        
 2:Extract_feature.py
        those lines of code is used for the calcultaion and extracting feature of it .
        the buy_sell_hold function use to assign the value if the calculated percentage change is grater then 1% =0.01 then 1 
        if the   percentage change is the less then 1% then -1
        else the value will assign to 0

        those lines of code is used for getting data at run time from internet using  Web crawling which is further used for the                   calcultaion and performing machine leraning Algo's.
        
 4:Machine_learning.py
        those lines of code used: its all about th ML algorithms 
                1: Linear SVM
                2: KNN 
                3: RandomForestClassifier     
         And used Voting clasifier for handle all these algorithm at the same time to produced high accurecy 
        
 5:Proccesing_data.py
        those lines of code used for processing the crawled data for make the data useful .
